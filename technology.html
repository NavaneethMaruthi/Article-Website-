            Google demonstrates vital step towards large-scale quantum computers

            Google has shown that its Sycamore quantum computer can detect and fix computational errors, an essential
            step for large-scale quantum computing, but its current system generates more errors than it solves.
          </p>
          <p>
            Error-correction is a standard feature for ordinary, or classical, computers, which store data using bits
            with two possible states: 0 and 1. Transmitting data with extra “parity bits” that warn if a 0 has flipped
            to 1, or vice versa, means such errors can be found and fixed.
          </p>
          <p>
            In quantum computing the problem is far more complex as each quantum bit, or qubit, exists in a mixed state
            of 0 and 1, and any attempt to measure them directly destroys the data. One longstanding theoretical
            solution to this has been to cluster many physical qubits into a single “logical qubit”. Although such
            logical qubits have been created previously, they hadn’t been used for error correction until now.
          </p>
          <p>
            Julian Kelly at Google AI Quantum and his colleagues have demonstrated the concept on Google’s Sycamore
            quantum computer, with logical qubits ranging in size from five to 21 physical qubits, and found that
            logical qubit error rates dropped exponentially for each additional physical qubit. The team was able to
            make careful measurements of the extra qubits that didn’t collapse their state but, when taken collectively,
            still gave enough information to deduce whether errors had occurred.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kelly says that this means it is possible to create practical, reliable quantum computers in the future.
            “This is basically our first half step along the path to demonstrate that,” he says. “A viable way of
            getting to really large-scale, error-tolerant computers. It’s sort of a look ahead for the devices that we
            want to make in the future.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The team has managed to demonstrate this solution conceptually but a vast engineering challenge remains.
            Adding more qubits to each logical qubit brings its own problems as each physical qubit is itself
            susceptible to errors. The chance of a logical qubit encountering an error rises as the number of qubits
            inside it increases.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a breakeven point in this process, known as the threshold, where the error correction features
            catch more problems than the increase in qubits bring. Crucially, Google’s error correction doesn’t yet meet
            the threshold. To do so will require less noisy physical qubits that encounter fewer errors and larger
            numbers of them devoted to each logical qubit. The team believes that mature quantum computers will need
            1000 qubits to make each logical qubit – Sycamore currently has just 54 physical qubits.
          </p>
          <p>Peter Knight at Imperial College London says Google’s research is progress towards something essential for
            future quantum computers. “If we couldn’t do this we’re not going to have a large scale machine,” he says.
            “I applaud the fact they’ve done it, simply because without this, without this advance, you will still have
            uncertainty about whether the roadmap towards fault tolerance was feasible. They removed those doubts.”
          </p>
          <p>
            But he says it will be a vast engineering challenge to actually meet the threshold and build effective error
            correction, which would mean building a processor with many more qubits than has been demonstrated until
            now.
