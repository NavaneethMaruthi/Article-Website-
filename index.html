              Google Pixel 6 to have new AI Tensor chip

              Google is set to launch its new phones, the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6
              Pro, powered by a new artificial intelligence (AI) chip.
            </p>
            <p>
              Known as Tensor, it’s the company’s first custom-built, system on
              a chip (SoC) that will use AI and machine learning (ML) to guide
              the phone’s operations.
            </p>
            <p>
              “It’s not simply about adding more computing resources, it’s about
              using that ML to unlock specific experiences for our Pixel users,”
              Google said on its blog.
            </p>
            <p>
              Google sees AI as underpinning its innovations, but up until now
              computing limitations had prevented it from fully pursuing its
              mission, so it worked to build its own technology platform for
              mobile that enabled it to bring its most innovative AI and ML to
              the Pixel.
            </p>
            <p>
              “We set out to make our own System on a Chip (SoC) to power Pixel
              6. And now, years later, it’s almost here,” the company said.
            </p>
            <p>
              Launching in the US autumn and light on technical detail at this
              stage, Google is promising big things with the new Pixel,
              including the Tensor SoC and Android 12, billed as its fastest on
              internal benchmark tests, smartest and most secure Pixel yet. “A
              new design that combines the same beautiful aesthetic across
              software and hardware,” it promises.
            </p>
            <p>
              With Tensor, Google has customised it to run Google's
              computational photography models, bringing new features and
              improvements to existing ones.

              The rear camera system will get a boost from improved sensors and
              lenses, now too big to fit into the traditional square, requiring
              a new design that gives the whole camera system a new home with
              the camera bar. It’s also getting a security boost, with a new
              security core and Titan M2, claiming the most layers of hardware
              security in any phone, based on a count of independent hardware
              security subsystems and components.
